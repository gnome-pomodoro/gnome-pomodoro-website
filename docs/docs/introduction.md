you need to set the width to 100% otherwise it will be only be as wide as it determines it needs to be. However, if the table rows total width is greater than the width of bar it will expand to its needed width. IF i recall you can counteract this by setting display: block !important; though its been awhile since ive had to fix that. (im sure someone will correct me if im wrong).
